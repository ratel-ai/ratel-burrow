/**
 * Ported from Ratel Cloud's `lib/intent-graph/boost-view.ts` (keep in sync).
 * Pure view model for the Boost panel: does the intent graph move the target
 * up the list? Scores a graph's experiment selections turn by turn, at a
 * cutoff, for a reference arm and the adaptive arm. No DB, no React.
 *
 * The contract with runtimes: an experiment named `adaptive-ranking:<source>`
 * with the arm `adaptive` (the catalog with the graph) and, usually, one
 * reference arm the customer chose:
 *
 * - `baseline`, the plain Ratel catalog, or
 * - `legacy`, the ranker Ratel is replacing, sending as many results as the
 *   customer cares to compare against (top-1, top-3, top-5).
 *
 * What counts as right on a turn, the target, is not a setting. It is the
 * invoked tool when the runtime reported one; else the reference arm's own
 * list, graded by rank (its first result is worth 1, its second 0.63, and so
 * on), so the score reads as agreement with that list. A turn whose target is
 * the reference list scores the adaptive arm only; the reference curve
 * averages the turns it was measured on independently.
 *
 * Turn order is the order Cloud stored the comparisons in. Online begins at
 * the first search the adaptive arm served (a shadow arm boosts without the
 * agent seeing it), else at the first boost a runtime reported from this
 * graph, else it is unknown.
