/**
 * Ported from Ratel Cloud's `lib/trace-signals/shape-story.ts` (keep in sync).
 * The turn-shape pictograms as a short story on a loop, kept pure so the
 * component only draws and the timing can be tested.
 *
 * Every piece of a row runs the same cycle, shifted by its moment in the
 * story, and the cycle opens on the build, so a row starts telling its story
 * the moment the section comes into view. Each shape's cycle is only as long
 * as its own story plus a short hold, so no row sits still for long:
 *
 *   0 ms            the first mark builds up from a dim outline
 *   300 ms          every other piece arrives, left to right, piece by piece
 *   built           the finished picture holds for 900 ms
 *   built + 900     the picture fades as a wave in reading order
 *   ... + 360       it is gone, but the first mark only dims and never leaves
 *   ... + 120       the next cycle builds again
 *
 * The first mark is the anchor: it dims to a floor and starts back at once,
 * so no frame of the loop is ever an empty pictogram. Until a row's loop
 * starts (a hidden tab, no script, reduced motion, or a section not yet seen)
 * every piece sits at its final look, so the first paint is the finished
 * picture. Once started, a piece waiting for its moment holds the cycle's
 * opening frame: the anchor dim, the rest not yet there.
